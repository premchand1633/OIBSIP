Email spam detection is the process of automatically identifying and filtering out unwanted or unsolicited emails from a user's inbox. It involves:

Collecting email data (spam and legitimate emails).
Preprocessing and extracting features from the emails.
Training a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) on labeled data.
Evaluating the model's performance.
Integrating the model into email services for real-time spam detection.
Regularly updating and maintaining the system to adapt to new spam tactics.
